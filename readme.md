# Land Area Calculator and Map Creation Tool
This tool was developed through the Python language for the creation of the calculation process. 
The calculator develops through the Arrays and Libraries on python for the data display.
The shoelace formula was used as the basic theoretical background of the land area calculation process in this tool. 
This project theoretical background was python software background with using its libraries. Numpy, Osgeo, Tinker, GDAL, Mapplot, Matplotlib, Gmplot, Tkinter and Geopanda were used as the libraries. This tool is user friendly to calculate the area using multiple points of the polygon. It also has the ability to convert the units of an area based on user requirements. As an advantage, this tool can show the hitherto unknown shape of the land. 


## Motivation Fact
The land sustains every aspect of our lives, providing fundamental life-support systems and the foundation of our economy and society. Calculating land area is one of the most important data collection and analysis tasks in modern world. There wasn’t a proper tool link with GIS platform to calculate the Area. If it was, it will be useful and productive for single users. (Single User;Surveyors, Students, Undergraduates,  Farmers, Engineers and the Researchers)

## The objective of the creating Tool
* To calculate an unknown land area  of any land on the Earth plane surface
* To identify the hitherto unknown shape of a land  
* To create the  Area Map of any unknown lands 
* To help for advanced GIS analysis with the future development of this tool
* This tool will help to any operator calculate the land area
 

## Tool will be solve the Problem of...
*	Calculate the Shoelace Algorithm with any polygon using the coordinates (point file).
*	Create the Map in Arc GIS using those coordinates 
*	Link and Displaying shape file as an output    

## What we learn…
*	About the Shoelace Algorithm
*	Usages of Python language and Libraries. 
    - To calculate the Shoelace Algorithm, need “Arrays, For Loop”
    -	To link calculation with Coordinates and Display need to learn about the Libraries. 
    - To convert the X & Y coordinates to the point shape file (GIS platform). 
* Create the User segment with PyQt 5 process and Gui Interfac

## Table of Content
  1.	Define the Polygon
  2.	Input Conner coordinates of Defined Polygon/ Land (These Coordinates will be added on Array)
  3.	The Array Data is linked with the Algorithm
  4.	Calculate the Area of Defined Polygon/ Land 
  5.	Linked the Area with GIS shape file. 
  6.	Display the Map output on GIS Platform
## Installation Method 
*   Create Gui Interface to develop the Installaition Process
*   Create *exe file with the PyQt 5 



## How to usage
* Click multiple times around the map to define an area
* The calculated area will then be displayes below the map
