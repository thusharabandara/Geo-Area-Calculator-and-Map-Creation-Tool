# Land Area Calculator and Map Creation Tool

## Motivation Fact
The land sustains every aspect of our lives, providing fundamental life-support systems and the foundation of our economy and society. Calculating land area is one of the most important data collection and analysis tasks in modern world. There wasn’t a proper tool link with GIS platform to calculate the Area. If it was, it will be useful and productive for single users. (Single User;Surveyors, Students, Undergraduates,  Farmers, Engineers and the Researchers)

## The objective of the creating Tool
*	To create the area Map with calculate perimeter for GIS users. 
*	This tool will be implement the advantages for advanced GIS analysis. 
*	This tool will help to surveyors for calculate the land measurements. 

## Tool will be solve the Problem of...
*	Calculate the Shoelace Algorithm with any polygon using the coordinates (point file).
*	Create the Map in Arc GIS using those coordinates 
*	Link and Displaying shape file as an output    

## What we learn…
*	About the Shoelace Algorithm
*	Usages of Python language and Libraries. 
    - To calculate the Shoelace Algorithm, need “Arrays, For Loop”
    -	To link calculation with Coordinates and Display need to learn about the Libraries. 
    - To convert the X & Y coordinates to the point shape file (GIS platform). 
* Create the User segment with PyQt 5 process and Gui Interfac

## Table of Content
  1.	Define the Polygon
  2.	Input Conner coordinates of Defined Polygon/ Land (These Coordinates will be added on Array)
  3.	The Array Data is linked with the Algorithm
  4.	Calculate the Area of Defined Polygon/ Land 
  5.	Linked the Area with GIS shape file. 
  6.	Display the Map output on GIS Platform
## Installation Method 
*   Create Gui Interface to develop the Installaition Process
*   Create *exe file with the PyQt 5 



## How to usage
* Click multiple times around the map to define an area
* The calculated area will then be displayes below the map
