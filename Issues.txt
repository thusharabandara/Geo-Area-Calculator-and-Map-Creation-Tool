sir, 
Could you pay your attention for following issues please?

1.Unable to adjust the places of entry boxes in GUI.
2.Are there any possibility to name the each entry boxes (as coordinate 1, coordinate 2…)? ( Entry boxes are generated using grid)
3.Unable to scroll the entry boxes, when the number of points are in higher value. (we are trying to search it )
4.Unable to find the way to remove the ‘entry boxes grid’ when resetting
